Here is a pseudo code representation of the provided SAS code, broken down into key points:

1. **Program Metadata**
   - Define the program name and title.
   - Specify the product and system compatibility.
   - Include references and usage instructions.

2. **Cleanup Phase**
   - Delete any existing tables `RDTAB78`, `CRTAB78A`, and `CRTAB78B` from the library `mydblib`.

3. **Create Initial Table**
   - Create a new table `RDTAB78` in `mydblib`:
     - Loop through values of `x` from 1 to 10.
     - Loop through values of `y` from 1 to 10.
     - Output each combination of `x` and `y` to the table.

4. **Set Options for SQL Execution**
   - Set the option `nodbidirectexec` to disable direct execution of SQL commands.

5. **First SQL Execution Block (No CTAS)**
   - Start a SQL procedure with error handling.
   - Create table `CRTAB78A` in `mydblib`:
     - Select `y` from `RDTAB78` where `x` is greater than 5, ordered by `y`.
   - Create table `CRTAB78B` in `mydblib`:
     - Select distinct `y` from `RDTAB78` where `x` is greater than 5, ordered by `y`.
   - End the SQL procedure.

6. **Store Results in Work Library**
   - Create dataset `noexeA` in `work` from `CRTAB78A`.
   - Create dataset `noexeB` in `work` from `CRTAB78B`.

7. **Cleanup After First SQL Execution**
   - Delete tables `CRTAB78A` and `CRTAB78B` from `mydblib`.

8. **Set Options for Direct SQL Execution**
   - Set the option `dbidirectexec` to enable direct execution of SQL commands.

9. **Second SQL Execution Block (With CTAS)**
   - Start a SQL procedure with error handling.
   - Create table `CRTAB78A` in `mydblib`:
     - Select `y` from `RDTAB78` where `x` is greater than 5, ordered by `y`.
   - Create table `CRTAB78B` in `mydblib`:
     - Select distinct `y` from `RDTAB78` where `x` is greater than 5, ordered by `y`.
   - End the SQL procedure.

10. **Store Results from Second Execution**
    - Create dataset `exeA` in `work` from `CRTAB78A`.
    - Create dataset `exeB` in `work` from `CRTAB78B`.

11. **Compare Datasets**
    - Compare `noexeA` with `exeA` for equality and report differences.
    - Compare `noexeB` with `exeB` for equality and report differences.

This pseudo code outlines the logical flow and operations performed in the original SAS code, focusing on the key actions and their purposes.
